Let me start by recalling what I know about the human body. I remember that the body has different parts, and each serves a specific function. 

First, the options are Bladder, Kidney, Ureter, and Urethra. I think the Bladder is the part that stores urine, right? So when you urinate, you pass through the Bladder. That makes sense because I've heard that the Bladder is where urine is stored and eliminated.

Let me start by recalling what I know about the human body. I remember that the body has different parts, and each serves a specific function. 

First, the options are Bladder, Kidney, Ureter, and Urethra. I think the Bladder is the part that stores urine, right? So when you urinate, you pass through the Bladder. That makes sense because I've heard that the Bladder is where urine is stored and eliminated.
